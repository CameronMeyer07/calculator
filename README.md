# calculator

The first part of the calculator is to recreate the look of the calculator
I created 3 divs for this operation.

used CSS to style them and used flex to create the gridlike display.

The calculator project is quite a daunting task.
Everytime I think I'm getting somewhere.
I realise I'm nowhere.
This is one of the hardest things I've tried in a long time.
It's fun but also makes me feel unintelligent.
I've been at this for a couple of weeks and thought I was getting somewhere.
Then came this project.

This was and is one of the hardest projects I have tried.
Thinking I did good on the Etch-a-Sketch. Getting this project done
had me scouring the internet for everything. 
Looking up things I didn't know existed.
I watched a couple of videos explaining different concepts.

I still don't fully understand everything. 
But as time goes on and I learn more I'm sure I will
improve.
